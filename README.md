# Javascript-Coding-Quiz-Homework

This assignment is a coding quiz made using Javascript HTML and CSS. The quiz contains a start button, quiz questions, countdown timer and leaderboard. If a user gets an answer incorrect then 5 seconds of the overall 75 seconds is subtracted. If a user gets a question correct the timer remains unpenalized. The final score at the end of the quiz is determined by the timer number. The quicker and more accurate a user answers questions the better their score will be. At the end of the quiz a user can enter their name to a leaderboard which is stored in local storage.
